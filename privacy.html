                                When you use a location-enabled service, we may collect and process information about your actual location, like GPS signals sent by a mobile device.
                                We may also use various technologies to determine location, such as sensor data from your device that may, for example, provide information on nearby Wi-Fi access points and cell towers.

                                 such as for automatic updates.
